plot6    displays and plots 3d planes, 6 at a time 

 Syntax: plot6(startplane#,endplane#,<'pos' or 'neg'>,<levels>,<spacing>,<dc2d>)

 Description: This macro will produce a series of plots showing 6 planes
              at a time. The axes are correct and a line above each 2D plane
              indicates the plane # in the other dimension, the nucleus for
              that dimension and its chemical shift. This macro is based on 
              the plplanes macro. DC correction  using dc2d('f1') or dc2d('f2')
              is done optionally .

              "page" is automatically done at the end

              Display of similar sized plots is done 4 at a time using the`
              macro "stack4"

 Examples:    plot6(1,64,'pos',12,1.3)
