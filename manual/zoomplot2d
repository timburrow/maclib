  zoomplot2d - "zoomed" 2D plot (skipping 2D noise)		      (macro)
*******************************************************************************

  Syntax:       zoomplot2d<(levels<,spacing>)>
		zoomplot2d('pos'<,levels<,spacing>>)
		zoomplot2d('neg'<,levels<,spacing>>)

  Description:  very often an overview 2D plot (cosy, noesy) contains vast
		areas where there is only noise, and where also theoretically
		no cross- or diagonal peak can appear. "zoomplot2d" will
		create a full size 2D plot where the noise is left out, and
		the areas which can have signals are blown up accordingly.
		All signals are expanded by the same ratio, which depends on
		the amount of signal-free areas in the spectrum.

		The information where signals can be is taken from the
		integration reset points in f2. The best solution is, to
		set these reset points in the setup spectrum (integrate all
		signals with pltmod='partial'). If this step was omitted,
		transform an f2 trace with all signals ('wft(1)' for noesy,
		'wft(ni)' for dqcosy spectra) and set the integration reset
		points (again with pltmod='partial'). Avoid too many integral
		regions, and don't make them too narrow.
		[ Integration reset can also be set from within dconi: switch
		to trace='f2', type 'cz' and use the cursor in dconi and the
		command 'z' to set the reset points one by one. Disadvantage:
		you can't see the integrals, and typing 'z' is more unhandy
		than using a function key within 'ds'. ]

		"zoomplot2d" will create a square-shaped plot as big as
		possible; no 1D traces are provided. By default it will
		draw seven contours at a spacing of 2. Arguments (optional):
		  - 'pos': only draw positive contours
		  - 'neg': only draw negative contours
		  - levels: the number of contour levels (default:7)
		  - spacing: the spacing of the contour levels (default: 2)

		Typically "zoomplot2d" will be used on overview spectra
		(full spectrum on display), but it also works for symmetric
		expansions (sp=sp1, wp=wp1). "zoomplot2d" currently only
		works for cosy/noesy-type spectra (sw=sw1) [ In theory the
		same algorithm could also be applied to heteronuclear
		correlations ].

  Example:	zoomplot2d
		zoomplot2d('pos')
		zoomplot2d('neg')
		zoomplot2d(12)
		zoomplot2d(12,1.3)
		zoomplot2d('neg',12,1.5)
