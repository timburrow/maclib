svspec                 Save spectrum (and fid)

               Syntax: svspec(filename<,'nofid','dos'>)

          Description: Saves a spectrum in the file "filename" in an identical
                       manner that svf saves a fid (except this version
                       requires a filename as input). No "rtspec" is provided;
                       the fundamental purpose of this program is for
                       transferring spectra to other software for manipulation.

                       Optional keywords (which can be used in any order) are:
                       'nofid' suppresses saving the fid in the file
                       'dos' (or 'DOS') converts the text and procpar files to
                         DOS format

             Examples: svspec('mydata')
                       svspec('mydata','DOS','nofid')
