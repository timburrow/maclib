convolutep           Convolute a waveform shape with n frequencies and phases

             Syntax: convolutep('rawshape','newshape',width,freq1,phase1,
                                 freq2,phase2,...freqn,phasen)

        Description: Takes a shape in the user's shapelib, convolutes it with
                     one or more frequencies, each with its own starting phase
                     shift, to generate a Shifted Laminar Pulse (S.L.Patt,
                     J. Magn. Reson., in press), and writes the new shape into
                     a new shape file. The width of the pulse is entered in usec
                     and is most conveniently entered as the name of a
                     parameter, e.g., pw. Frequencies can be either positive
                     or negative.

                     No check is made by the macro to see that the frequencies
                     entered satisfy the Nyquist limit, i.e., that the phase
                     change per step is less than 180 degrees.The macro also
                     assumes that any comment lines contained in the shape file
                     are found at the beginning of the file.

           Examples: convolutep('gauss','newgauss',pw,500,0)
                     convolutep('gauss','offsetgauss',1000,100,0,300,180)
