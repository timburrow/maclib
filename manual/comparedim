  comparedim   - compare f1 and f2 equivalents of a 2D expansion      (macro)
  plcomparedim - plot comparison of f1 and f2 equivalents	      (macro)
*******************************************************************************

  Syntax:       comparedim<(levels<,spacing>)>
		comparedim('pos'<,levels<,spacing>>)
		comparedim('neg'<,levels<,spacing>>)
		plcomparedim<(levels<,spacing>)>
		plcomparedim('pos'<,levels<,spacing>>)
		plcomparedim('neg'<,levels<,spacing>>)

  Description:  Very often 2D spectra have an inherent diagonal symmetry,
		but it is not possible or undesirable to symmetrize the data
		for one of the following reasons:
		  - fn<>fn1
		  - potential loss of small crosspeaks
		  - crosspeaks close to a suppressed solvent line that are
		    only visible on one side of the diagonal and would get
		    lost during symmetrization).
		Still in these cases it helps in excluding possible artifacts
		if one can compare equivalent portions of such a 2D spectrum
		from both sides of the diagonal.
		"comparedim" shows these equivalent portions on a split screen,
		in f1 and f2 orientation (such that a direct comparison is
		possible). It comprises the following features:
		  - the area between the cursors (in "box" mode) is selected
		    for expansion
		  - depending on the ratio wc/wc1 and the orientation of the
		    spectrum the screen is split horizontally or vertically
		    (comparedim tries to get the f1 and f2 expansion rates
		    [hz/mm] as balanced as possible)
		  - depending on the data size contour displays or a simple
		    color map is displayed (mainly for speed reasons)
		  - Optional arguments:
		      + 'pos' / 'neg' allow to display positive or negative
			levels only (default: positive and negative signals)
		      + levels: number of contour levels (default: 20)
		      + spacing: spacing of contour levels (default: 1.5)
		    Whenever a level number is specified, contours are
		    displayed instead of a color map.
		  - the display is reactivated at the end
		  - instructions on how to switch back to the original (full)
		    display are shown on line3

		"plcomparedim" does the same, but makes output to the plotter.
		The default number of contour levels for "plcomparedim" is 12.

  Example:	dconi		[ adjust cr/delta, cr1/delta1 ]
		comparedim	[ compare displays, using cursor ]
		r9 dconi	[ select the next area ]
		comparedim	...
		r9 dconi

		comparedim('neg')
		comparedim(3,3)
		comparedim('pos',5)
		comparedim('neg',30,1.3)
		plcomparedim('neg',30,1.3)
