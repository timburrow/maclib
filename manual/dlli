  Syntax:	dlli<(range)><:r1>
		nlli<(range)><:r1>

  Description:	"dlli" produces a line listing which also includes an integral
		for each individual line found, in contrast to the "dll" com-
		mand which only lists peak heights (apart from the frequency
		information).
		"dlli" evaluates the integral around each line: normally 10 Hz
		are included on each side of a line (this range can be altered
		with an optional argument). When two lines are closer to each
		other than twice the range, the split point calculated: if the
		two lines are different in size, the split point is set closer
		to the smaller line. The command was written for the integra-
		tion of line spectra like C13 - for complex multiplet spectra
		(like H1) the result will not be adequate (use "region" in-
		stead).
		"dlli" creates a file "lli.out" in the current experiment
		Note that "dlli" removes the integral reset points.
		Both "dlli" and "nlli" return the number of lines found.
		"nlli" is identical to "dlli" except that it doesn't display
		the results.
		For performing a baseline correction prior to calling "dlli"
                or "nlli" we recommend using "maclib/bcdc".

  Examples:	dlli		[ equivalent to dlli(10) ]
		dlli(20)
		nlli		[ equivalent to nlli(10) ]
		nlli:r1
