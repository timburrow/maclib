getxpk 		Get cross-peaks from a 2D data set

Syntax:		getxpk<('reference')>

Description:	1) join an experiment with a processed 2d data set 
		2) prepare a peak list peaks.bin in the current experi-
		   ment using the ll2d menu functions from dconi
		3) cd to a directory in which you want to write all the
		   volume integral information
		4) type getxpk('reference') to establish a file in this
		   directory named xpk.ref which will be a copy of the
		   mark2d.out file and which will be used to establish
		   the reference regions. The macro checks if the file
		   peaks.bin exists, and if it does, converts it into
		   an ASCII file ll2d/mark2d.out.
		   This command will also create a reduced file con-
		   taining only region index and volume integral; this
		   file will be named xpk.nnn, where nnn is the mixing
		   time in msecs.
		5) join other experiments or recall other 2D data sets
		   into the same experiment, as desired, and type
		   getxpk; repeat step 6 for all mixing times;
		   a series of xpk.nnn files will be created.
		6) process the series of lists with 'buildup' (at least
		   four different mixing times are required)
