dsvpl - displays vertical plane at the cursor position   

features : Works with all three orthogonal planes
             irrespective of what the trace parameter is.

           Displays the chemical shift of the plane index.

           If getplane had not been done for the new plane    
             macro will enquire if you want to do getplane.

           Uses the axis parameter to calculate the chemical
             shift and nucleus label of the new plane.

usage : With any 2D plane display (typically the projection)
          point the cursor cross-wire on the cross peak of interest
          and execute the macro.

        If the new plane does not exist in the extr directory
          the macro will enquire if you want to do getplane.
          If the answer is 'y': "getplane" is executed for the new
          plane and the appropriate plane is displayed.
          If the answer is 'n': the macro is aborted.
