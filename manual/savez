savez		Save a FID to a disk file with name incrementation

Syntax:		savez(filename)

Description:	Saves a FID to a named file, checking first for the existence
		of the file and, if it exists, incrementing the filename. The
		intention is to allow saving a series of FIDs at each block
		size for whatever purposes this might be useful for. The
		command can also be used simply to save a FID at the very
		end of the experiment using wexp.

Examples:	n1='/home/vnmr1/myfid' wbs='savez(n1)'
		n1='/home/vnmr1/data/C13_menthol' wexp='savez(n1)'
