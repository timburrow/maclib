csll		CSEARCH line list

Syntax:		csll<('all')>
		If 'all' keyword is included, solvents are included as type='s'
		csll alone omits solvent output

Description:	Expects to find a DEPT analysis (dept.out) file in the
		current experiment, and that the experiment currently
		has a 1D 13C spectrum on which a line list has been
		performed (using dll or nll). These two pieces of
		information are combined, together with information
		in /vnmr/solvents on where the solvent lines are
		expected, to produce a "smart" line list with the
		various peaks labelled. The output should be (but is
		untested) compatible with the CSEARCH format (CSEARCH
		is a spectral database searching program from
		Sadtler). This macro should be considered prototypical
		and by no means fully tested. Output from the macro is
		sent to the file csll.out in the current experiment,
		and is also displayed. Note that the line list output
		is combined with the text from the experiment which
		serves as a header for the file.

		If dept.out is not found, the carbon type of all carbons is
		set to a blank space.
