convolute            Convolute a waveform shape with n frequencies

             Syntax: convolute('rawshape','newshape',width,freq1,freq2,...freqn)

        Description: Takes a shape in the user's shapelib, convolutes it with
                     one or more frequencies to generate a Shifted Laminar
                     Pulse (S.L.Patt, J. Magn. Reson., in press), and writes
                     the new shape into a new shape file. The width of the
                     pulse is entered in usec and is most conveniently entered
                     as the name of a parameter, e.g., pw. Frequencies can be
                     either positive or negative.

                     No check is made by the macro to see that the frequencies
                     entered satisfy the Nyquist limit, i.e., that the phase
                     change per step is less than 180 degrees.The macro also
                     assumes that any comment lines contained in the shape file
                     are found at the beginning of the file.

           Examples: convolute('gauss','newgauss',pw,500)
                     convolute('gauss','offsetgauss',1000,100,300,-200)
