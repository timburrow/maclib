  plhxcor   - plot X,H-correlation 2D spectrum	(M)
*******************************************************************************

  Syntax:	plhxcor<(levels<,spacing<,exp1D_H<,exp1D_X>>>)>
		plhxcor(sign<,mult1H>,<,levels<,spacing<,exp1D_H<,exp1D_X>>>>)
		plhxcor(mult1H<,sign><,levels<,spacing<,exp1D_H<,exp1D_X>>>>)

  Description:	"plhxcor" automatically plots 2D spectra of type hetcor, coloc,
		hmqc, hmbc (direct and indirect detection). Features:
		  - it keeps the orientation (f1, f2) of the spectrum on the
		    screen
		  - the plot area is optimized
		  - number of contour levels and their spacing can be selected
		  - negative or positive contours can be suppressed
		  - 1D proton and X traces can be plotted along both axes;
		    such 1D traces are taken from full (or reduced) 1D spectra
		    in other experiments
		  - it also works correctly for expansions
		  - the 1D traces can be suppressed, which allows it to use
		    a larger area for the 2D spectrum
		  - the 1D spectra can be in any experiment
		In multi-experiment mode, for the first plot the experiments
                with the 1D spectra should be specified (at least if they are
                not in exp1 and exp2). From then on, the 1D spectra will be
		stored WITHIN the experiment with the 2D spectrum, which allows
                much faster switching between the spectra and also frees
                the other (1D) experiments for other tasks. Because of this
                "internal storage" the "exp1D_H" and "exp1D_X" arguments are
		not required for subsequent plots.
                The command supports positive-only or negative-only contour
                plots. The 1D traces (if available / requested) are automatically
                scaled in order to fit the available space; if this results in
                an underscaled 1H trace, "vs" for this trace can be multiplied
		(from the automatic scaling) by 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, or 100.

		Arguments:
		  - levels: the number of contour levels; default: 7 contours.
		  - spacing: the spacing between the contours; default: 2.
		  - exp1D_H: the experiment in which the proton 1D spectrum
		    resides; this can be a full 1D spectrum, but the referen-
		    cing must be the same as for the 2D (see below). A nega-
		    tive number will suppress the proton trace. Default is
		    1 (exp1).
		  - exp1D_X: the experiment in which the "X" 1D spectrum
		    resides (see above); again, a negative number suppresses
		    the "X: trace. Default: 2 (exp2).
              The command supports two optional string arguments; these can be
              used in any order, but must be specified prior to the numeric
              arguments mentioned above:
              sign - 'pos' = only plot positive contours
                     'neg' = only plot negative contours
              mult1H - 'x2' = multiplies vertical scale of 1H trace by 2
                       'x5' = multiplies vertical scale of 1H trace by 5
                       'x10' = multiplies vertical scale of 1H trace by 10
                       'x20' = multiplies vertical scale of 1H trace by 20
                       'x50' = multiplies vertical scale of 1H trace by 50
                       'x100' = multiplies vertical scale of 1H trace by 100

  Examples:	plhxcor			( equivalent to "plhxcor(7,2,1,2)" )
		plhxcor(12,1.5)		( equivalent to "plhxcor(12,1.5,1,2)" )
		plhxcor(7,2,3)		( equivalent to "plhxcor(7,2,3,2)" )
		plhxcor(7,2,1,3)
		plhxcor('pos',7,2,-1,3)
		plhxcor(7,2,-1,-1)
		plhxcor('neg')
		plhxcor('neg','x10')
		plhxcor('x5','pos',12,1.5)


  Usage:	A typical sequence of actions for acquiring and plotting a
		hetcor spectrum stepwise and in multiexperiment mode will be
	        as follows:
		  - acquire a proton spectrum in exp1
		  - enter the text and reference the spectrum NOW (before
		    moving the fid to an other experiment)
		  - acquire a C13 spectrum in exp2
		  - reference the spectrum NOW (again, before moving the fid
		    into an other experiment) and fetch the text from exp1
		    [ mt(1,2) ].
		  - mf(1,3) jexp3 wft ... movesw
		  - mf(2,4) jexp4 wft ... movesw
		  - call the macro for the 2D experiment (e.g., "hetcor") and
		    acquire the 2D spectrum
		  - process the 2D spectrum
		  - for plotting with traces type "plhxcor" (the defaults fit).
		  - for expansions select the expansion and type "plhxcor"
		    again.
