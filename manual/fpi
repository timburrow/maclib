 fpi - report integral values from arrayed spectra  (M)
*****************************************************************************

      Syntax: fpi<('bc')>
	      fpi<('dc')>
	      fpi<('t1')>

 Description: Following the definition of integral regions (either by hand,
	      or using the region command), "fpi" measures the height of each
	      integral in an array of spectra. If the keyword 'bc' or 'dc' is
	      specified, one of commands is used to flatten the baseline or
	      remove any baseline offset prior to evaluating the integrals.
	      The results of the analysis are written into the text file
	      "fpi.out" in the current experiment directory.
	      Note: "fpi" always works on the entire spectrum, i.e., it will
	            produce a report on all defined integral regions.
		    Note also that "fpi" will indicate the integration limits
		    in ppm units if "axis='p'" - if you prefer Hz units, set
		    "axis='h'" prior to calling "fpi".
	      The resulting output, "curexp+'/fpi.out'" does NOT comply with
	      the VNMR commands for T1 analysis etc. - however, if an argument
	      't1' is used, "fpi" and creates a file "curexp+'/fp.out'" which
	      CAN be used for T1, T2 etc. analysis (note that in this case
	      the "line positions" marked in this file are mid-points of the
	      respective integral region).

   Arguments: 'bc' - optional baseline correction on each spectrum
	      'dc' - optional offset/drift correction on each spectrum
	      't1' - optional creation of "curexp+'/fp.out'" which is
		     compatible with "t1" and related commands
	      The 'bc' and 'dc' arguments cannot be combined.

    Examples: fpi
	      axis='h' fpi axis='p'
	      fpi('dc')
	      fpi('bc','t1')
	      fpi('t1','dc')
	      fpi('t1')
