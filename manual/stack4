stack4    displays 3d planes, 4 at a time on the screen, with labels

 Syntax: stack4(startingplane#,endingplane#,<'pos' or 'neg'>,<levels>,<spacing>

 Description: This macro will produce a series of displays showing 4 planes
              at a time. The axes are correct and a line above each 2D plane
              indicates the plane # in the other dimension, the nucleus for
              that dimension and its chemical shift. This macro is based on 
              the dsplanes macro. 

              Plotting of similar sized plots is done 6 at a time using the`
              macro "plot6"

 Examples:    stack4(1,64,'pos',12,1.3)
