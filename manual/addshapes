addshapes   Add two waveform shapes to form a new, composite shape

 Syntax: addshapes('shape1',mult1,phase1,'shape2',mult2,phase2,'output')
            where: shape1, shape2 are the names of existing .RF shapes in
                     shapelib which do NOT contain any comments
                   mult1, mult2 are multipliers to weight that particular shape
                   phase1, phase2 are phase shifts for that particular shape
                   output is the name of a new file in shapelib

 Description: Two .RF shapes in shapelib are added vectorially, with optional
   independent weighting factors and phase shifts and placed into a new shape.
   If the two shapes are not the same number of steps, the resulting shape is
   as long as the longer of the two shapes, with the two shapes centered.
   The output is normalized by two, so if the weighting factors (mult1 and
   mult2) are each 1.0, the power must be increased by 6 dB (or the pulse
   lengthened by a factor of 2) compared to a single shape to keep the
   effective pulse width the same.

 Examples: addshapes('gauss',1.0,0.0,'sinc',0.5,90.0,'sum')
