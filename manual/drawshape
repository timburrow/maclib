drawshape              Draws waveform shapes on the screen or plotter

               Syntax: drawshape(shapename<,'phase','amplitude','plotter',
                        'maxy',maxy,'color',color,'vp',vp,'nolines',]
                        'noclear','no180'>)

          Description: Draws a waveform shape (amplitude and phase) on the
                       screen or plotter. Scales the y-axis assuming that the
                       shape ranges from 0-1023 and the x-axis according to
                       the number of steps in the shape. Only '.RF' shapes are
                       drawn. "shapename" is first looked for in the user's
                       shapelib and then in the system shapelib.

                       The optional keywords are:
                       'phase' plots the phase of the shape only
                       'amplitude' plots amplitude only
                       'plotter' indicates to plot instead of draw the shape
                       'nolines' does not draw vertical lines between steps
                       'maxy',maxy sets the maximum y scale
                          (which otherwise defaults to wc2max)
                       'color',color sets the color (default 'yellow')
                       'vp',vp sets the starting vp (default 0)
                       'noclear' doesn't clear screen
                       'no180' doesn't show 180 phase changes as negative
                           amplitude"

             Examples: drawshape('gauss')
                       drawshape('gauss','plotter','amplitude','maxy',40)
                       drawshape('hrm90','nolines','color','red','noclear')
