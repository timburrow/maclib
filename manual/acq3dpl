 acq3dpl - Acquire 3D spectra as a series of f1f3 planes (M)
*******************************************************************************

      Syntax: acq3dpl<(altexp<,filename>)>

 Description: "acq3dpl" is a macro that allows acquiring 3D spectra as a
	      series of f1f3 planes. While this prevents the VNMR command
	      "ft3d" from being used (processing with external software
	      packages required) it offers the advantage of giving faster
	      access to a complete f1f3 plane.
	      The acquisition is performed by alternating between two
	      experiments: this permits continuous acquisition with minimal
	      inter-plane delays. For TPPI data ("phase2=3") the odd plane
	      numbers will be acquired in the starting experiment, the even
	      planes in the alternate experiment. For States ("phase2=1,2")
	      experiments the starting experiment will be used to acquire the
	      planes with "phase2=1", the alternate experiment for the planes
	      with "phase2=2". The alternate experiment can either be
	      specified as first argument (numeric), or it can be entered
	      interactively. The data will be stored in a directory under the
	      names
			plane001.fid
			plane002.fid
			...
	      The name of the directory for storing these planes can be given
	      as second argument, or again be entered interactively. If an
	      absolute pathname (starting with "/") is given, that directory
	      is created. If a simple, relative pathname is given, that
              directory is creates as subfile of "userdir+'/fidlib'"; if a
	      multi-level filename is given, all directories (except for the
              lowest-level one) must already exist.
	      The initial two planes (one in each experiment) are submitted
	      by the "acq3dpl" macro; subsequent planes are queued by a macro
	      "continue3d". During the experiment there will always be one
	      active experiment (acquiring) and one experiment in the queue,
	      such that both experiments will appear busy to the user.

   Arguments: "altexp" (optional) is the number of the alternate experiment.
	      "filename" (optional) is a directory name for storing the
		planes; the directory will be created if it doesn't exist. If
		a relative pathname is given, it is assumed to be a subfile of
		a directory "fidlib" in the user's "~/vnmrsys" ("userdir").

    Examples: acq3dpl
	      acq3dpl(7)
	      acq3dpl(3,'lysozyme.hncoca')
	      acq3dpl(9000,'/data/vnmr1/lysozyme/hncoca')
