calcphase	Calculate the phase of a spectrum based on the FID

Syntax:		calcphase

Description:	For situations in which the first complex point of the FID
		occurs exactly at time zero (e.g., an echo), the phase of
		a spectrum can be calculated by examing the first real and
		imaginary point and calculating the arc tangent; this is
		what calcphase does. The calculated phase is simply
		displayed, not applied to the spectrum.
