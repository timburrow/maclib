set_vt		Change the temperature in a "safe" manner

Syntax:		set_vt [Interactive mode, asks for temperature]
		set_vt(Desired temperature)
		set_vt('n') or set_vt('off')

Description:	set_vt activates the temperature controller, changes the
		temperature, and then deactivates the temperature controller
		so that no inadvertant changes to the temperature will occur.
		The user is asked for one or more confirmations of the
		requested action. Note that this method of changing the
		temperature is NOT compatible with running multiple experiments
		at different temperatures under computer control (nor with
		a temperature array)
