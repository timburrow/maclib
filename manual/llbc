  llbc	-	perform baseline correction based on line listing    (macro)
*****************************************************************************

       Syntax:	llbc<(tail)>

  Description:	"llbc" determines integral reset points based on a line
		listing and performs a (spline) baseline correction
		[ bc(1,80) ] on the signal-free regions of the spectrum.
		llbc assumes that the threshold (th) has been adjusted
		beforehand. All lines from the line listing (based on the
		current threshold) are integrated with "tail" (in Hz) size
		noise tails on either side; if two lines are closer than
		2*tail, they fall into the same integral region. "tail" can
		be entered as argument; the default tail size is sw/100.
		If "tail" is selected too small, llbc may attempt to create
		too many integral regions.
		After performing the baseline correction, "llbc" reestores
		the integral reset points.
		To integrate C13 and similar spectra, you may want to use the
		"dlli" / "nlli" macros from the "maclib/dlli" contribution.

    Arguments:  "tail" (optional) is the size of the "noise tail" which is
		added on either side of a line, as part of the signal. It
		should cover the ENTIRE "foot" of the broadest signal. The
		default tail size is "sw/100".

     Examples:  llbc		[ equivalent to llbc(sw/100) ]
		llbc(20)
