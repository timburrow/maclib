makehard	Make a hard pulse shape with any number of steps

Syntax:		makehard(#steps<,amplitude>)

Description:	The output is a file in your personal shapelib named
		  hard#steps.RF, e.g., hard256.RF.
		If amplitude is omitted, it is assumed to be 1023
		If amplitude is less than zero, the phase is changed to 180
		If amplitude is between 0 and 1, this is taken as a fractional
		  amplitude and multiplied by 1023

Examples:	makehard(256)
		makehard(64,-512)
		makehard(1024,.25)
