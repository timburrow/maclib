fpdc		Find peaks (for T1 analysis) with drift correction

Syntax:		fpdc

Description:	Finds the peaks in a series of spectra in preparation for a
		T1 (or T2 or other) analysis, outputting the data into the
		file fp.out in the current experiment. Like fp, this command
		should be preceded by setting the threshhold and displaying
		the peaks (using dll or nll) in a single spectrum of the
		array.

		Unlike fp, this macro does NOT currently support arguments
		for selecting which lines, i.e., it finds peaks for all lines.

		Like fp, it uses the parameter npoint as a search limit
		(default: 2) in order to accomodate peaks which move slightly
		from spectrum to spectrum. To disable the "npoint search range"
		use
			create('npoint','integer')
			setgroup('npoint','display')
			npoint=0

		Typical usage: Set th, followed by: nll fpdc t1
